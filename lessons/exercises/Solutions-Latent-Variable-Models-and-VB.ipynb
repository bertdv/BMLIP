So apparently the entropy of the posterior $q(z)$ is maximized.

Minimizing the energy term leads to aligning $q(z)$ with $\\log p(x,z)$, ie, it tries to move the bulk of the function $q(z)$ to areas in $z$-space where $p(x,z)$ is large ($p(x,z)$ is here just a function of $z$, since x is observed). However, aside from aligning with $p(x,z)$, we want $q(z)$ to be as uninformative as possible. Everything that can be inferred should be represented in $p(x,z)$ (which is prior times likelihood). We don't want to learn anything that is not in either the prior or the likelihood. The entropy term balances the energy term by favoring distributions that are as uninformative as possible.     \n",
