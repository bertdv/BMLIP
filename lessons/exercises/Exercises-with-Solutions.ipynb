    "### Prelude \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this notebook, we provide a set of exercises that should help you prepare for the exam. There are two sets of exercises: \n",
    "  1. (**5SSB0**). The first set contains questions from previous exams of class 5SSB0 (Adaptive Information Processing). 5SSB0 was last taught at TU/e in the academic year 2018/19. Starting with the academic year 2019/20, the current class (5SSD0) is offered instead. In comparison to 5SSB0, the emphasis of the current class is more on the Bayesian framework, rather than maximum likelihood. Below, we present a selection of exercises that were used in the 5SSB0 exams. While these exercises may not represent the emphasis on Bayesian methods, they do represent the \"style of questions\" and the \"level of difficulty\" that you may expect in upcoming 5SSD0 exams. Also, there is nothing in the questions below that is considered outside the scope of 5SSD0. \n",
    "  2. (**Rehearsal**). A second set of exercises are categorized by lesson headers, e.g., \"Probability Theory\" or \"Generative Classification\". These exercises intend to test you on the contents of the corresponding lesson. Of course, for some exercises you may need some contents of some other (usually earlier) lessons or background materials. A perfect categorization is not feasible, but we've tried to link each question to a lesson so as to make it easier to test yourself after studying a specific lesson.     \n",
    "  \n",
    "- For some of these exercises you will be able to find solutions quickly on the internet. Try to resist this route to solving the problems. You will not be graded for these exercises and solutions will be made available in a separate notebook. **Your ability to solve these exercises without external help provides an excellent indicator of your readiness to pass the exam**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook is still under construction. We will be adding more exercises to help you prepare. Also, not all solutions are provided yet. We are working on this too. If you absolutely need the solution for a problem that doesn't have a solution yet, please contact one of the TAs (see http://bmlip.nl for contact info.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- As 2019/20 is the first time we teach this class, please be alert to errors (and let us know if you find any!) or more generally, let us know if things are unclear to you or if a question can be improved. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We are aware there are some rendering problems in some browsers. We are trying to fix that as well. \n",
    "\n",

Aside from the computational advantages (operations on distributions tends to make them more Gaussian, and Gaussians tends to remain Gaussians in computational manipulations), the Gaussian distribution is also the maximum-entropy distribution among distributions that are defined over real numbers. This means that there is no distribution with the same variance that assumes less information about its argument. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **[1]** (##) I asked you to watch a video segment (https://www.vibby.com/watch?vib=71iPtUJxd) where Karl Friston talks about two main approaches to goal-directed acting by agents: (1) choosing actions that  maximize (the expectation of) a value function $V(s)$ of the state ($s$) of the environment; or (2) choosing actions that minimize a functional ($F[q(s)]$) of *beliefs* ($q(s)$) over environmental states ($s$). Discuss the advantage of the latter appraoch. \n",
    "  > We'll discuss two advantages here. Either one would suffice for full credit and there are likely multiple alternative answers that would be adequate as well. (1) One advantage is that the value function $V$ needs to be uniquely chosen for each problem. Brains cannot afford to come up with a new value function for each problem as thousands of new problems are encountered each day. In contrast, $F[q(s)]$ holds the free-energy functional (a given cost functional) for posterior beliefs that technically are defined by a generative model $p$ and Bayes rule. In other words, in the latter approach, there is one value (cost) function for *all* problems. (2) A second advantage of $F[q(s)]$ is that inference for actions can take into account the uncertainty about our state-of-knowledge of the environment. This may lead to actions that are information seeking rather than goal-driven if our belief are very uncertain. For instance, if I want to cross a street, my first actions will be to seek information (look for cars and how fast they go), and only after enough information has been collected, the goal-driven action (decision) cross-vs-stay will be executed. When minimization of $F[q(s)]$ drives actions, both information-seeking and goal-driven actions can be accomodated in the same framework. This is very difficult when the value function is a direct function of the state of the world ($V(s)$, because there is no accomodation to represent our uncertainties about the state of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **[2]** (#) The *good regulator theorem* states that a \"successful and efficient\" controller of the world must contain a model of the world. But it's hard to imagine how just learning a model of the world leads to goal-directed behavior, like learning how to read or drive a car. Which other ingredient do we need to get learning agents to behave as goal-directed agents? \n",
    "  > In the Free Energy Principle framework, goals (targets) are encoded in a generative model of the environment as prior distributions on future observations. Actions are inferred through free energy minimization in this extended model. As a result, the inferred actions aim to generate future observations that are maximally consistent with the goal priors. This kind of behavior can be interpreted as goal-directed behavior.\n",

    "- **[3]** (##) The figure below reflects the state of a factor graph realization of an active inference agent after having pushed action $a_t$ onto the environment and having received observation $x_t$. In this graph, the variables $x_\\bullet$, $u_\\bullet$ and $s_\\bullet$ correspond to observations, and unobserved control and internal states respectively. Copy the figure onto your sheet and draw a message passing schedule to infer a posterior belief (i.e. after observing $x_t$) over the next control state $u_{t+1}$. \n",
