    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- This course provides an introduction to Bayesian machine learning and information processing systems. The Bayesian approach affords a unified and consistent treatment of many useful information processing systems. \n",
    "- Upon successful completion of the course, students should be able to:\n",
    "  - understand the essence of the Bayesian approach to information processing.\n",
    "  - specify a solution to an information processing problem as a Bayesian inference task on a probabilistic model.\n",
    "  - design a probabilistic model by a specifying a likelihood function and prior distribution; \n",
    "  - Code the solution in a probabilistic programming package.\n",
    "  - execute the Bayesian inference task either analytically or approximately.\n",
    "  - evaluate the resulting solution by examination of Bayesian evidence.\n",
    "  - be aware of the properties of commonly used probability distribitions such as the Gaussian, Gamma and multinomial distribution; models such as hidden Markov models and Gaussian mixture models; and inference methods such as the Laplace approximation, variational Bayes and message passing in a factor graph.
